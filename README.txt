**DATA FILE**
Two tab-delimited text files training_data.txt and test_data.txt are provided.The training data (labeled activity information included) is used to construct and test the ML algorithms. After that, applying algorithm to the test data (containing only feature information) and predict the activity corresponding to each time window.

**Task**
*1. Build a binary classifier to classify the activity of each time window into static (0) and dynamic (1). For this task, consider postural transitions as static (0).*

  
*2.Build a refined multi-class classifier to classify walking (1), walking_upstairs (2), walking_downstairs (3), sitting (4), standing (5), lying (6), and static postural transition (7)*
